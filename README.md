# iQuest
iQuest is a web app, which is a question&amp;answer community, you can ask questions and answer questions. I finished the website with the help of the book "Ruby on Rails 4 Tutorial"<br>
To run this APP, you should install RubyMine first, and it's easier than using command. Then get the gems listed in the Gemfile.
